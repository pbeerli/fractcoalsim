the simtree.pdf is the result of running simtree.tex
to check the pyton code run:
python simtree.py -h

an example run with plot is:
python simtree.py -i 10,10 -l 5000  -t 0.01,0.01 -m 100,100 -a 0.95,0.9 -p   


the code below was used the create the histograms
python simtree.py -i 10,10 -l 5000  -t 0.01,0.01 -m 100,100 -a 0.999,0.999 -p; mv simtreefig.pdf simtree-0.999-0.999.pdf
